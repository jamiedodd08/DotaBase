# DotaBase
Final year project - University of Lincoln

This is my final year project for my BSc Computer Science degree at the University of Lincoln, I have developed a website using Flask/HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery also
including a database using mySQL. 

My projects goal was to use a centric design approach to develop a new crowdsourced knowledgebase for Dota2 to help new players in learning the game, the systems 
main aim is to support players by displaying what items to pick in certain situations and why, it will also show hero counters to help in the draft phase.
